I recently reengaged w/ a wonderful band of hackworthy humans doing some very cool things in _Agda_.
I needed to dust of my Agda coding skills and remember how to interact w/ its proof assistant and needed a focal point.
Just before leaving my last job, we'd been reading Conal Elliott's _The Simple Essence of Automatic Differentiation_.
So, I decided that I'd try proving some of the isomorphisms Conal reveals in that paper, in Agda.
