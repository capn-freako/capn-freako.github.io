Wendy & I have relocated to the Berkshires.
Specifically, we've landed in [Lenox, MA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenox,_Massachusetts).
And we love it!
The town's motto is: _Where city culture meets country living_.
And it couldn't be more apt.
It's a wonderfully sleepy town of 5,000 people, but sporting several upscale restaurants, botiques, coffee houses, and even a Frenc patisserie!

We see the sun set over the Berkshires from our living room window and it's beautiful!

You should really come visit. :)
